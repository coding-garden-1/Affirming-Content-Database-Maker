I guard my mental space fiercely and reject any negativity from my thinking.
My mind is a peaceful place where only useful thoughts are allowed.
I am the gatekeeper of my life and I only grant entry  to thoughts that help me.
I have the perfect resources to accept positive thoughts into my new self.
I am always empathizing and being grateful.
I am always seeing people's side of things & realizing a realistic solution is in order for me
I am always knowing my own value as a human being and never feeling bad about who I am
