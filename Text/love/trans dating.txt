I am a normal girl healing
I never have to feel bad about who i am
I am starting to date girls i really like
I identify as a girl who meets girls she is attracted to
I am never desperate for any love
I am always existing in special girl on girl relationships
I know my worth and value as a girl
I look so pretty
I feel so pretty and always feel proud of who i am
I never feel ashamed 
I never let anger hurt me
I never let anyone hurt me
I always heal and process my emotions
I always process my emotions in the best ways that lead me to feeling grounded
I get the best girlfriends ever
I am always attracting the best girlfriends into my arms
I am always having safe, enjoyable sex with attractive trans girls
Trans girls like me because I am beautiful
It is becoming normal for me to be in a relationship with a trans girl I like
It is becoming normal for hot and normal trans girls to ask me out
It is becoming normal for me to be pursued by hot trans girls I like
I am never chasing for trans girls because they come to me

I never have to feel bad about who i am
I am starting to date trans girls i actually like
