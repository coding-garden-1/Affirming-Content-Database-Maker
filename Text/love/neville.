The Immutable Authority of Self: You are the one.

Close your eyes and envision a reality where your every desire is met with unwavering affirmation. In this realm, there exists no obstacle too formidable, no opposition too formidable to thwart the unyielding resolve that resides within you. For you, my beloved, are the arbiter of your destiny, the final authority in the grand tapestry of your existence.

Reflect upon the words that resonate within your soul: "Nobody could ever tell you no, however hard they tried." What does this statement signify but the immutable truth that your power transcends the limitations imposed by external forces? It is a declaration of sovereignty, a testament to the divine birthright bestowed upon every soul that walks this earthly plane.

At the heart of our exploration lies the profound truth that we are not slaves to our emotions, but sovereign rulers of our inner realm. Picture, if you will, a tempest raging within, threatening to engulf the shores of your consciousness. Yet, in the eye of the storm, you stand resolute, a beacon of calm amidst the chaos.

To be not triggered is to transcend the fleeting impulses of the ego, to anchor oneself in the unshakable foundation of self-awareness. It is the recognition that external stimuli hold no dominion over our inner state unless we willingly relinquish our power. Through intentional choice and muting out all else, we reclaim our sovereignty, steering the ship of our emotions with unwavering resolve. And with this we create our world.
