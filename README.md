## ACDM

Collect the language you love like you're shopping at the supermarket, then use it to reprogram your brain.

ACDM takes in positive language, then analyzes it with a finetuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI and the principles of NLTK analysis. This breaks the language you love down into its essential linguistic components, which are further analyzed for their affirming potential. For the next step of the process, an AI is trained on this language, so every new belief it gives you makes you feel empowered, refreshed, and ready to live life stronger.

## Usage

Assemble the language you love into a JSONL or TXT file with new lines.

Run "pip install openai nltk"

Run "python3 database_generator.py"
